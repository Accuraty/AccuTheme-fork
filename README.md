# Accuraty Templates

A set of templates for building fast and effective websites. This is an attempt to create a set of standards and best practices for Accuraty projects.

## Overview

Accuraty primarily works with two content management systems: DNN and WordPress. The files included in each folder are designed to be a start template for each platform.

The template includes the source Sass files from Bootstrap v4.0.0-apha.6 (Updated 1/20/2017).

## DNN

To use this template, navigated to the `Portals/_default/Containers` and the `Portals/_default/Skins` folders in your DNN project and create a new folder in each place (use the client abbreviation Accuraty uses elsewhere as the name). Copy the contents of this template's `containers/` and `skin/` folders into these newly created directories.

## WordPress

(Nothing currently created.)
