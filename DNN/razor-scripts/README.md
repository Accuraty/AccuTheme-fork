# Razor Scripts

The `razor-scripts/` folder contains scripts used by the Razor module. To add these files to a project, copy them into `DesktopModules/RazorModules/RazorHost/Scripts/`.

## File names

The naming convention for Razor scripts is underscore, client abbreviation, underscore, name, and the file extension `cshtml`. The files included in this starter template are basic scripts commonly used in our projects. To customize or add project-specific ones, please prefix those files with another underscore and the client abbreviation.

### Examples

Common file: `_SidebarMenu.cshtml`
Client-specific: `_ABC_ExamplePageList.cshtml`

## What is Razor?

Razor is a syntax based on ASP.NET that lets you easily embed C# or VB code inside an HTML page. It's not a programming language but a server-side markup language. Learn more [here](https://www.w3schools.com/asp/razor_intro.asp).
