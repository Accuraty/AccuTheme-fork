# Accuraty containers

We include this separate directory to keep the client folder focused on content specific to the client's website. Accuraty containers are more for development or to add custom plugins. Keeping these containers out of the client folder is helpful for site managers so they don't get distracted.

## PageNotes

Useful to leave behind important notes that will only be visible to admins or site managers. Built on Bootstrap's alert component.

## LazyYouTube

This module is required to use Accuraty's `lazy-yt` plugin. By including this container on a page, it will load the JavaScript (via Client Resource Management) and display notes to admins for reference.
