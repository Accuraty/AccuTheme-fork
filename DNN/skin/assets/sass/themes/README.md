# Themes

For large projects, it's not unusual to have different themes. When needed, place theme-specific styles in the `themes/` folder.

### REVISIT THIS PLEASE....

I considered leaving this folder out entirely, but there might be a good case to make for using this as a place to make overrides/changes/customizations for the Admin skin?
