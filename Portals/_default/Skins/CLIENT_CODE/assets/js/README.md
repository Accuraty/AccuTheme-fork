# JavaScript

The `js/` folder contains all scripts used in the project, whether they are custom or vendor files.

## Main file

Code you write for the project goes in `scripts.js`, which includes a DOM-ready JavaScript file setup so you can start development instantly.

## Vendors

If your project uses scripts from external libraries or frameworks, save these files in the `vendors/` directory. Code inside this folder is direct from the thid-party source and is not to be modified.
