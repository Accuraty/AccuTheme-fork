# Themes

This folder is where we save starter files to build a custom WordPress theme. When copying these files for use in a project, be sure they are added to `/wp-content/themes/{CLIENT ABBREVIATION}/`.

## What is a theme?

In WordPress, themes are a collection of **template files** that control the look of a website and the presentation of content. A theme modifies the way a site is displayed without modifying the underlying software. Themes include images, stylesheets, scripts, and various `.php` files.

### Template files

Template files are the building blocks of a WordPress site. A simple WordPress site structure includes three basic blocks: a header, the content, and a footer. Each of these blocks is generated by a template file in the theme.
