# Accuraty Templates

This is an attempt to create a set of standards and best practices for Accuraty projects in a way that is easy to deploy using modern web technologies and up-to-date frameworks.

## Overview

Accuraty primarily works with two content management systems: DNN and WordPress. The files included in each folder are designed to be a starter template for each platform.

The template includes the source Sass files from Bootstrap v4.0.0-apha.6 (Updated 1/20/2017) nested and integrated with our custom styles codebase.

### DNN

To use this template, navigate to the `Portals/_default/Containers` and the `Portals/_default/Skins` folders in your DNN project and create a new folder in each place (use the client abbreviation Accuraty uses elsewhere as the name). Copy the contents of this template's `containers/` and `skin/` folders into these newly created directories.
