# Accuraty Templates

This is a set of standards and best practices for projects in a way that is easy to deploy using modern web technologies and up-to-date frameworks. Accuraty primarily works with the DNN content management system. The files included are designed to be a starting point for this platform.

## Getting Started

At the root of your new project folder, run the following commands:

```
git remote add accuraty https://github.com/chrismlusk/accuraty-templates.git
git fetch accuraty
git merge accuraty/master
```

Then, navigate to the project's skin folder (e.g., `Portals/_default/Skins/CLIENT_CODE`) and run the following command:

```
npm install
```

Once the project dependencies are installed, run the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will kick off the Gulp tasks to initialize the project and begin watching for changes to source files.
