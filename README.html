<p>This is an attempt to create a set of standards and best practices for Accuraty projects in a way that is easy to deploy using modern web technologies and up-to-date frameworks.</p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Accuraty primarily works with two content management systems: DNN and WordPress. The files included in each folder are designed to be a starter template for each platform.</p>
<p>The template includes the source Sass files from Bootstrap v4.0.0-apha.6 (Updated 1/20/2017) nested and integrated with our custom styles codebase.</p>
<h3 id="dnn">DNN</h3>
<p>To use this template, navigate to the <code>Portals/_default/Containers</code> and the <code>Portals/_default/Skins</code> folders in your DNN project and create a new folder in each place (use the client abbreviation Accuraty uses elsewhere as the name). Copy the contents of this template&#39;s <code>containers/</code> and <code>skin/</code> folders into these newly created directories.</p>
